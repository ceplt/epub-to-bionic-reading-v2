# epub-to-bionic-reading-v2

Attempt to recreate https://github.com/ceplt/epub-to-bionic-reading but using rust to make it faster. It's mostly for science.

/!\ Work in progress

## Progress

The conversion works, but there is still small issues to fix and params to set like bold test percentage

## Run

```
cargo run # main.rs
```
